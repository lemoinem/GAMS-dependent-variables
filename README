GAMS dependent variables

This Perl script allow the use of dependent variables in GAMS (
http://www.gams.com/ ).

The syntax is:
GAMS-dependent-variables.pl result-directory/ dictionary [files...]

The dictionary is a file declaring the dependent variables. Empty lines are
ignored. One declaration per line, each declaration using the following syntax:
[comment :] name[(indice[,...])] = value;

Empty lines and lines starting by a '*' are ignored.

Dependent variables may include *previously* declared dependent variables in
their values. They cannot on themselves or on not-yet-declared dependent
variables.

If a variable (dependent or not) is used in the value of a dependent variable,
it should be used with the .l suffix.

The dependent variables may then be used in any GAMS file just as any other
variable.

Marginal value and lower and upper bounds are not supported for dependent
variables.

If you want to include a summary of the value of the dependent variables (once
only per GAMS model), include the 'display-dependent.inc' file (it will be
created by the script).
